The following Charter template is required to be used when submitting a Group Charter to the Technical Steering Committee for review and approval.  The Technical Steering Committee wants to ensure that there is a consistent level of detail from Charter to Charter throughout the Open Manufacturing Platform (OMP) by the use of this template.  
In addition, all Charters will be made available to the public in an attempt to better communicate the goals and objectives of the OMP.  
To this end, the Technical Steering Committee position on Charters is that they provide sufficient detail and depth so that a person who is unfamiliar with the group would be able to understand the basic dynamics and goals of that group.  
Charters that convey this information the best are generally three or four pages in length.  The following sections are required for all Charter submissions.
